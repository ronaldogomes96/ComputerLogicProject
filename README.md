# Minefield 

This repository contains the code made for the discipline of Logic for computing in the Computer Science course at IFCE.

The objective was to develop a solution for the minefield, passing a grid of determined size and obtaining places where the mine exists and locations where they do not exist. For that, concepts learned during the discipline were used, such as logical consequence, satisfiability, truth value and others.

The following algorithms were used:

- Brute force
- Tableaux
- DPPL
